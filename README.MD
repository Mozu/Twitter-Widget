# Mozu Widget Example -- Twitter Feed

## What's this?

This is a widget that renders a Twitter feed on your Mozu site, as described in this [blog post](http://www.need.link.to.post).

>**Note:** This widget is meant as an example only. You can use the process described in the blog post as a guideline for creating your own custom widgets for your Mozu site. This widget will not be maintained by the Core Mozu Team and is not meant for production use.

### Installation

There are three assets included in this git repository, located in `/dist`. 

1. Add these files in the following locations:

    `twitter-feed.hypr`
to **YOUR_THEME/templates/widgets/cms/twitter-feed.hypr**

    `twitter-feed.less`
to **YOUR_THEME/stylesheets/widgets/twitter-feed.less**

    `twitter-feed.js`
to **YOUR_THEME/scripts/widgets/twitter-feed.js**

2. After adding the files, run `grunt` to build your minified assets.

**Refer to the [blog post](http://www.need.link.to.post) for more information about installation and widget customization**
